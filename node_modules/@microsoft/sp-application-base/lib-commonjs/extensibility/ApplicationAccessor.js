 * Provides access to the client-side application that is currently running.

 * @remarks
 * The client-side application determines the user experience for an entire web page.
 * (It is a client-side component with a manifest; however, the SharePoint Framework
 * does not enable third parties to create their own client-side applications at this time.)
 * Within a web page, at most one client-side application will be running at a time.
 * Certain in-place navigation transitions can cause the application to be unloaded
 * and replaced by a different application.
 *
 * The ApplicationAccessor class enables extensibility components such as extensions
 * and web parts to interact with the currently running application.  It acts as
 * a proxy for the real application object (the BaseApplication subclass), to ensure
 * that extensibility components only rely on interactions that would be portable
 * across all applications.
